                A Meaning of Our Own: Man’s Search for Meaning - Viktor Frankl

                    <p>Viktor Frankl's concept of ‘Logotherapy’ is put on display using the narrative of his time in World War II concentration camps. He asserts that one of the reasons why he was able survive the incredibly harsh conditions of the camps can be entirely contributed to his will to survive. The will to live, Frankl asserts, is generated by the desire to understand the meaning of life. Meaning is derived from our perception and acceptance of events that occur throughout our lives. Both positive and negative life-events can help us develop a sense of meaning. For example, you can examine a negative event (being broken up with), to glean meaning (I have to learn more about myself before I can be a good partner to someone else), allowing you to foster a more abstract definition of your own personal meaning. Essentially, that negative event was a small piece in the cosmic puzzle that is finding the meaning of your life. As such, there is no ‘objective’ meaning of life. We as individuals are tasked with creating our own meaning.</p>
                    <p>The will to live is predicated on finding meaning. The more apathetic you become, the less willing you are to pursue goals. Frankl provides an example of the above through the experience of one of his concentration camp comrades. He was convinced that April 2nd 1945 would be the day that the camps were liberated. Most prisoners were suffering from typhus at the time and this mad had a particularly bad case. However, as the day approached, his belief held strong. He began to feel healthier and more alert. It was only as the date grew even nearer, with no sign of liberation in sight, that his health began to falter, and he died on April 3rd 1945, a day after he assumed they’d be free. Simply put, his meaning for living was predicated on surviving up to a certain point, when it looked as though his estimate was wrong, despite his strongly held belief, his ‘meaning’ for staying alive was stolen from him, and he died. In this way, 'meaning' can be seen as a kind of 'élan vital', or driving force for humans.</p>  
                    <p>According to Frankl, "We can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering" and that "everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances".</p>
                    <p>He also writes briefly about the idea that if you try too hard (hyper intention) to achieve something, the less likely you are to actually achieve it. Frankl claims that the way around this is by deliberately not doing the thing you’re trying so hard to do (paradoxical intention) </p>
                    <p>For example, if you’re trying to write a paper and you’re suffering writer’s block, putting the paper away and doing something else (procrastination) generally helps to put you back into a mental state that's conducive to writing, whereas attempting to push through the writer’s block would most likely lead to a wastebin full of scrap paper and a huge headache.</p>
                    <p>In sum, Frankl's ideas turn the traditional view of 'meaning' on its head. People strive for an idealized, objective meaning, in order to provide value to their lives. In a world where such objective meaning may not exist, putting the onus of purpose onto the individual is empowering. You don't need to climb a mountain, or read a library full of books in an attempt to search for some semblance of 'truth'. Instead, your purpose in life is uniquely your own. Every time you push past adversity, you are contributing to the development of your personal value. To me, Frankl's idea of meaning is modular, something that grows alongside you. From that angle, our individual futures seem rather bright.</p>

                To Believe. Or Not to Believe: A Brief Overview of Pascal's Wager

                <p>Pascal’s Wager is a philosophical argument that attempts to justify the belief of God using decision theory. Thought up by Blaise Pascal, the argument claims that the potential gain from believing in God is higher than the potential gain of not believing. According to Pascal, there are four potential stances one can assert:</p> 
                <p style={{textIndent: '0', fontWeight : 'bold', textAlign: "center"}}>A. Belief in God and God existing leads to eternal happiness.</p> 
                <p style={{textIndent: '0', fontWeight : 'bold', textAlign: "center"}}>B. Belief in God and God does not exist results in no discernable positive or negative outcome.</p>
                <p style={{textIndent: '0', fontWeight : 'bold', textAlign: "center"}}>C. Nonbelief and God does exist leads to eternal damnation.</p>
                <p style={{textIndent: '0', fontWeight : 'bold', textAlign: "center"}}>D. Nonbelief and nonexistence again results in no discernable positive or negative outcome.</p>
                <p>These outcomes are meant to prove that a belief in God is the most rational choice, as nonbelief has a chance of leading to eternal damnation, and thus, eternal suffering, whereas believing in God has no real negative consequence. So long as there is a nonzero probability of God existing, belief is the ideal choice, according to Pascal. Although on paper, Pascal’s argument is strong, there is a fatal flaw in his premise – he assumes that the God in question is the Roman Catholic version, brimstone hell and all. Not all modern religions subscribe to the notion of Heaven and Hell, making the options moot for all but traditional Christians.</p>

                <p>Pascal’s wager can really only be contested on the attribution of incorrect partitions to the argument. The utilities of Pascal’s Wager can also be contested to an extent, but not enough to invalidate the argument itself. The incorrect partitions argument claims that the arguments in Pascal’s Wager are not mutually exclusive or exhaustive, meaning there are other options available to a person, but are not being addressed by Pascal. This argument is justified as Pascal’s arguments are only applicable to a Roman Catholic version of Theistic belief, making it incompatible with differing religions, specifically those who do not believe in heaven or hell, or polytheists. The possibilities offered in Pascal’s Wager are not open to people who do not directly believe in the same interpretation of God as does Pascal. Pascal also attributes a utility of zero to all options based on Gods nonexistence (belief minus existence and nonbelief minus existence). It could be argued that there is a negative utility in belief without God, as the believer is forced to participate in religious services and ceremonies that can be inconvenient, uncomfortable, or both. Simultaneously, a positive utility can be assigned to nonbelief without God, as the nonbeliever is free live their life without fear of divine persecution. They can act according to their personal value systems, without the burden of ‘sin’ crossing their minds. These attributions eliminate dominance from Pascal’s Wager. Based purely on expected value however, Pascal’s Wager still holds up as no finite value can counter the infinite value granted from eternal paradise.</p>

                <p>In modern times, Pascal’s Wager holds much less clout than it did in the 18th century, when Roman Catholicism was more widespread and influential. Modern society is made up of people of many different races and creeds, many of which preach ‘rules’ that differ vastly from Pascal’s original muse. The concept of reincarnation, for instance, is based entirely upon the inherent ‘goodness’ of a person, is not based upon belief and has utilities that differ vastly from Pascal’s (being a good person leads to ascending higher, while a bad person will descend). Furthermore, Pascal’s argument requires that God’s existence is a nonzero probability, a pure atheist; nihilist or solipsist might not accept the notion of God’s existence at all, making Pascal’s argument null. As such, there are many obstacles reducing the viability of Pascal’s argument, making it widely inapplicable to many people, religious or otherwise and in tandem with the objections towards the wager addressed above, prove that Pascal’s Wager is incompatible with modern notions of God.</p>

                Shi'ite Luck: A View of the Cultural and Religious Misrepresentation of Isma’ilism

                    <p>Like most Shi'ite branches of Islam, the Nizari Isma’ilis believe in the hereditary lineage of Imams, whom are thought to be direct descendants of the Prophet Muhammad. Nizari Isma’ilis, of which this paper will exclusively focus on, make up the largest portion of the Isma’ili community today, and follow the Imam of the time, a modern-day descendant of the first Imam, Ali. Nizari Isma’ilis believe that the divine light, or nūr, was passed down from Imam to Imam, known as the Imamate. This nūr, considered the light of God, is what gives each imam his legitimacy and infallibility to the Isma’ili community and followers of the imams, called murids, derive their strong loyalty and spirituality from the belief in this nūr. The nūr is passed down hereditarily, and is said to always be present in a living vessel, the imam himself. This interpretation is unique to Nizari Isma’ilis, and remains an important element in their traditions to this day. Nizaris are also one of the few Shi'ite branches that do not believe in occultation, the idea that certain Imams went into hiding and, destined to return on the Day of Judgement. The Twelvers are one such group, who split from the Isma’ilis after the death of Imam Ja'far al Sadiq. The groups that believe in occultation claim that the hereditary passage of the nūr ended with the Imam that went into hiding, whereas the Nizaris claim that the Imamate, and thus the chain of succession, has not been broken. This consistency in their belief in the Imamate has allowed the Nizaris to develop and modulate themselves as a religious community alongside their Imams. Aga Khan IV, Prince Karim, is considered the 49th hereditary Imam, and is the current leader of the Nizari Isma’ili community. Nizari Isma’ilis today continue to believe that he possesses the nūr, giving him the same spiritual authority as Imam Ali. Further, the presence of a living Imam of the time has made the Isma’ilis a unique entity within the Muslim community, which has caused conflict in many Middle Eastern countries, where Sunni Islam remains the dominant ideology, hence the need to continue the practice of taqiyya in some parts of the world. The Fidai, Nizari warriors, who were originally trained under Hassan-i Sabbah, held steadfast to the belief of the passage of nūr, culminating in their absolute willingness to follow orders, without fear for their own safety. These Fidai play a prominent role in the development of the legends of the ‘hashashin’, or assassins by Western scholars and chroniclers. Isma’ilis believe in the transcendence of God; God is an existence that is beyond conception, and cannot be understood in human terms. Due to the presence of a living imam of the time, direct Quranic reliance is less prominent than in Sunni and other Shi'ite branches. This was exemplified by their beliefs in the bātin (esoteric) and zāhir (exoteric). To simplify, Isma’ilis believed that the spiritual, esoteric world was hidden and could only be accessed by certain groups. Isma’ilis believed that they could locate the bātin, or esoteric meaning, which was hidden within the zāhir, the perceived, literal world and the direct writings within the Quran, which were to be interpreted in accordance to the bātin. This conception further explains why few primary Isma’ili texts exist at all. The bātin was to be a secret concept, to be preserved by Isma’ilis. Due to their harsh persecution by Sunnis, as a result of their interpretive differences, Isma’ilis practiced taqiyya, or dissociation, in which they hid their religious practices, and created a veil of secrecy around their religion. This secrecy also plays into why only few primary Isma’ili texts exist, and what led to the greater acceptance of Sunni accounts of Isma’ili traditions, which were generally denunciatory and negative of Isma’ili (and Shi'ite, in general) cultural and religious practices. This history of persecution and secrecy within the Isma’ili community, as well as the emphasis on communal bonds and education, clearly illustrates why the Nizari Isma’ili community is so tight-knit. This communal bond, both religious and cultural also promotes charitable behaviour, both within and outside of the community.</p>

                    <p>Theologically, Isma’ilis place more emphasis on interpretation, than Sunnis do, Isma’ili religious practices are also generally dictated by the Imam of the time. The present living Imam is also thought to be the only one with a complete knowledge of the bātin and assists in the interpretation of the Quran, and other texts attributed to the Prophet. This is why there exists a discrepancy in the mechanics of prayer, such as a different number of required prayer times, between different Shi'ite sects, and between Nizari Isma’ilis and Sunnis. These theological differences also factor into the persecution of Shi'ites by Sunnis, who saw their religious practices and belief systems as illegitimate and heretical. Sunnis had a more literal interpretation of the Quran, and saw the Isma’ili reliance on the bātin as ignoring the actual words as they were written in the Quran. The Sunnis also denied the legitimacy and infallibility of the Imams, claiming that Prophet Muhammad did not designate an heir. This adamance explains why there has been very little deviation in Sunni religious practices and belief systems. Ultimately, given the nature of religious belief, enforcing strong faith, and the tense history between the Shi'ite and Sunni populations, conflict between the two groups based on these differences was inevitable.</p> 
                    <p>The Isma’ilis' practice of taqiyya has been present since the time of the first Imam, Ali. The practice of taqiyya, or caution, involves concealing one's beliefs or religious practices in fear of harm or persecution. Taqiyya has roots in the Quran, and the Al Ahl Bayut practiced it in the years following the death of Prophet Muhammad. It was practiced by Shi'ite communities, due to the civil tensions within the Muslim community regarding the succession of the Prophet Muhammad. The original supporters of Abu Bakr developed into the first Sunni communities, while those who supported Ali, and the Al Ahl Bayut, developed into the Shi'ites. Since the Abu Bakr supporters greatly outnumbered Ali's supporters, Abu Bakr became the first caliph and the de facto leader of the Muslim community. Due to the severe persecution of Shi'ites, owing to their minority status and difference in religious views, Shi'ites—particularly the Isma’ilis—continued to practice taqiyya in order to avoid harm to themselves and their communities. This concealment of religious practices promoted the word of mouth passage of these practices in Shi'ite communities, rather than having them written down. A common view was that Shi'ites were following a distorted or incorrect view of Islam, and that the Sunni view was the 'right' one. During the Fatimid and Alamut periods, Nizari Isma’ilis held a relatively substantial amount of power, and there was less fear of persecution. This led to the writing of texts on Isma’ili history and practices, which were subsequently destroyed when these periods of prosperity ended, and Sunnis regained dominance. Going further, Sunni scholars also created fabricated accounts of Shi'ite culture and practices, in an attempt to discredit their beliefs and to denounce their communities. Sunni polemicists, and scholars would outwardly refer to Isma’ili views as heresy, and referred to them as atheists. Daftary (1990) claims that these Sunnis would also create fabricated texts that were attributed as real Isma’ili works. These works, asserts Daftary, were made to present Isma’ilis as practitioners of heretical and immoral rituals. These false Sunni accounts would later play into the misconceptions of the Isma’ilis by European explorers, which eventually spread across the globe, and developed the popularization of the assassin myths.</p> 
                    <p>The Alamut period (around the 11th Century, CE) seems to be the point where the popularized view of Isma’ilis was incepted into Western ideology. This was the period where European scholars, travelers and crusaders were coming into close contact with the Muslim world in Syria. Travelers, such as Marco Polo, began writing of the 'assassins' and their extraordinary skill and loyalty to their master, the alleged 'old man of the mountain'. These assassins were the 'Fidai', warriors that held high regard to the Isma’ili religious doctrine. The name assassin was a bastardization of 'hashishi', which was a derogatory term used by Sunnis to refer to Isma’ilis. The term carried connotations of hashish usage, and was interpreted by Western travelers as the Alamut Isma’ilis being regular hash users. This idea was inducted into Western writings on the Isma’ilis, and was used to justify the extreme loyalty of the Fidai. According to these European accounts, the 'masters' of the Fidai, such as Hassan-i Sabbah, called 'the old man of the mountain', used hash to induce an elated or psychoactive m state for potential followers, called the 'garden of paradise'. Some writers even claimed that there was, in fact a real garden, with beautiful women and streams of milk and honey, created by Sabbah, despite no evidence of such a garden existing. Daftary (1990) asserts that such an interpretation was popularized by European travelers, because they were otherwise unable to comprehend the sheer faith in the beliefs that the Fidai possessed. European writers, like Dante, took inspiration from the accounts of these 'assassins', utilized creative liberties in their writing and simplified entire existence of the Fidai into the concept of them being trained killers for hire. Thus, the Western interpretation of the Isma’ili assassins stems from a difference in belief systems, coupled with the false information about Isma’ili culture they were gleaning from the local Sunni population, who's writings about the Nizari Isma’ilis were the only texts available to the European travelers at the time. It is easy to see how such accounts can be interpreted in a way that makes the Nizari Isma’ili community look like obsessed fanatics at best, and bloodthirsty murderers who used intimidation and violence to expand their operations at worst. Such an interpretation is an extremely limited view that focuses on a minimal aspect of Isma’ili history, and completely glosses over the communal and progressive elements of Isma’ili culture. Regardless, the assassin legends were the one piece of Isma’ili knowledge that became popularized in the West and its persistence remains indicative of the permanence of fabricated viewpoints, so long as they fit into the larger community's belief systems.</p>
                    These views on Isma’ilis remained consistent and unchanged until the 19th century, when scholarship in Isma’ili history saw a resurgence and the contemporary Nizari imams, the Aga Khans, emerged as important political figures who were themselves involved in the social and cultural globalization of their Isma’ili community. This can be seen in the philanthropic organizations and institutions created by the present Imam Aga Khan IV, Prince Karim, such as the Aga Khan Development Network, and the University of Central Asia, an offshoot of Aga Khan University. These endeavours aim to promote the globalization of the Isma’ili community, and promote education and economic support to developing countries. The influence of these institutions, as well as the increase in academic research on the subjuct and the spread of the Isma’ili community across the globe have slowly helped to modify the antiquated views on Isma’ili culture that had been perpetrated by the medieval Sunnis and Europeans. As the Aga Khans continue to become a global force, the perception of Isma’ili community will hopefully shift to one that is more representative of Isma’ili culture and religion. 

                    <p>In sum, there exists a huge degree of misinformation surrounding Isma’ili culture and religion, partially spread maliciously, partially spread out of ignorance. Given that Nizari Isma’ilis make up a large portion of the Shi'ite community, numbering around 20 million followers, it is important that any misconceptions about such a large group do not persist, especially if such rumours are negative and have the potential to cause harm to the community they are about. After examining the origins and contents of these rumours, it is clear that the popularized perceptions of Isma’ili society and actual Isma’ili society were and remain distinctly different entities. In the years to come, these perceptions may begin to shift, given the more open nature of the Nizari Isma’ili community today.</p>

                <p style={{textAlign : 'center', fontWeight : 'bold'}}>I: What is Insider Trading?</p>
                <p>Insider trading is the act of using non-public or 'insider' information about a company when trading that company's stocks or assets on the public market, and can be legal or illegal depending when and how the stock was bought or sold (Meulbroek 1992, Reichman 1993). Insider trading is said to be legal when a company executive buys or sells shares of their company's stock at specific points in time in which there exists no insider information which would sway the public's opinions on the value of a particular company’s stock. Company executives can also plan in advance the sale of their shares, such as at their retirement (Montagano 2012:581). These trades must be disclosed to the public and the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) or equivalent financial security institution outside of the U.S, must be made aware of these trades in advance. Conversely, illegal insider trading is the criminal offense of using non-public or 'insider' information as the basis for making trades on the stock market. Information such as; expected profits or losses, the stepping down of a key figure in the company, or a company acquisition or merger, which has not been disclosed to the public, and has the potential to affect stock prices, is considered 'insider information' (Walter 2012). Most illegal insider trading occurs in North America, Europe and Asia, in capitalist societies with strong financial markets (Montagano 2012). Most illegal insider trading is committed by corporate executives and high-ranking corporate employees, who are able to obtain insider information about their company easily, due to their position. Insider trading can be committed by anyone, however, given that they have somehow become aware of insider information, by being 'tipped off' by a company insider, intentionally or accidentally, and have used that information to make trades on the stock market (Reichman 1993). Shareholders, according to Seyhun (1992), also benefit heavily from insider trading, leading to lapses in corporate regulations by those who own company stocks.</p>

                <p>There has been a good degree of research on the effects of illegal insider trading on stock prices and the health of the market, and on potential remedies to it. The causes of insider trading have not been addressed as in-depth, however, given that the primary benefit of the practice is financial gain, it is safe to assume that monetary incentive is a primary drive for insider traders (Lippke 1993). In regards to its effect on the financial market, the research is inconsistent, but leans towards the idea that illegal insider trading has a negative impact on market equity, and stability (Lippke 1993). Some studies show that insider trading as a practice actually helps to make the market more accurate, which makes sense, given insider information is based on the factors surrounding a company's future economic gains and losses (Leland 1992:862). However, much research has shown, conversely, that increasing penalties for illegal insider trading actually results in a healthier market, with stock prices better reflecting a company's value (Beny 2005:145-146). Beny also asserts that markets become more equitable when insider trading laws are more prevalent, particularly deterrence-based policies, such as fines and prison sentences, which prevent more powerful corporate entities from continuously growing, allowing for a more even spread of market wealth. Montagano (2012) supports this assertion, by pointing out that stricter enforcement of SEC penalties helps to promote trade within its stock markets by increasing trader confidence (576-577). Similarly, there is a negative correlation between profits from insider trading, and the implementation of harsher insider trading laws (Bris 2005:269). Reichman (1993), claims that insider trading leads to greater market corruption, through propelling market values that favour particular corporate entities over other investors (55-56). The economic benefit of deterrence policies on insider trading is important to note, as it addresses the multifaceted importance of promoting insider trading laws, while also addressing how illegal insider trading promotes an unfair consolidation of power, ultimately hurting the free-market. Given that research on the changes to the market based on increased penalties for insider trading in the U.S has shown that harsher penalties result in a fairer market, it is safe to assume that illegal insider trading has a negative correlation to the health of the stock market, which greatly favours companies with more assets.</p>
                <p>The vast majority of research points to the conclusion that a deterrence approach is best suited for reducing rates of illegal insider trading. Beny (2005), Bris (2012), Montagano (2005) and Walter (2012) all argue that harsher penalties, both via the SEC and the CJS, targeted towards the company from which the insider was working, and on the insider themselves, respectively, have helped to reduce rates of illegal insider trading within the U.S between the mid-1980s to today (Meulbroek 1992). Such penalties include heavy fines, jail time, and restrictions on the trading of company securities. This has the twofold approach of directly targeting the perpetrator, while also increasing intra-company surveillance of worker activities. Such measures can also to deter anyone in possession of insider information from making trades based on that information. Dooley (1980) made the claim that enforcement of insider trading sanctions is necessary, and that the lax state of insider trading laws at the time were not sufficient enough to deter people capable of illegal insider trading from doing so. The fact that after the implementation of stricter laws in the 1990s and 2000s, insider trading rates began to decline in the U.S (Beny, Montagano) further supports the argument that deterrence measures are the most effective at combatting illegal insider trading. To that end, insider trading rates in the U.S are decreasing, giving credence to the idea that if similar measures were applied in the markets of other countries, such as Canada or China, insider trading rates would also decrease in these areas.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, illegal insider trading is a prevalent issue in many modern and economically prospering societies, and is mostly committed by people in higher management positions within corporations. Studies have almost unanimously concluded that deterrence, through increased penalties, both financial security organization-based (such as the SEC), and CJS-based, through fines and jail time, are the most effective methods of reducing the rate of insider trading. As has been suggested throughout the literature, the increasingly harsher penalties for insider trading in the U.S, has resulted in lower rates of the practice. If similar deterrence measures extended to Canada and Europe, then a reduction in the rate of insider trading in these areas would likely occur as well, and these countries may also reap the economic benefit of having a more stable, fair and trustworthy market.</p>

                <p style={{textAlign : 'center', fontWeight : 'bold'}}>II: Combatting Insider Trading</p>

                <p>Based on the literature, a deterrence-based approach for insider trading looks to be the most effective method of reducing the occurrence rate of illegal insider trading in general. Increasing the penalties meted out for insider trading violations by both the SEC and CJS, as well as the utilization of third-party surveillance to increase the transparency of company actions would all play into the reduction of illegal insider trading. Given the reduction of insider trading rates in the States, this section will focus on applying U.S-based deterrence measures to other countries, such as Canada, with comparatively higher rates of illegal insider trading. In relation to insider trading rates, there is a significant difference between the profits earned from insider trading between the U.S (0.86%) and Canada (35%) (Bris 2005:287). Bris also suggests that profitability decreases as a result of harsher insider trading laws. This clearly outlines that a shift in regulation to a more States-centric model may help to reduce rates of insider trading in other areas. Further, non-criminal measures, such as SEC involvement and an increased focus on intra-company regulations, will also be addressed, and can be applied to the pre-established measures in the U.S. As addressed in the previous section, deterrence measures are most effective at combatting illegal insider trading, and as such, will be argued as the primary solution to the issue. </p>
                <p>In terms of the implementation of these deterrence measures, a joint effort between the CJS and the country’s SEC-equivalent financial security institution is necessary. As seen by their positive effects on rates of insider trading in the States, criminal penalties, such as higher fines and longer rates of incarceration are a good first step. On the financial security front, harsher penalties, such as company-wide trade bans, would help promote deterrence within the walls of a corporation. By enforcing company-wide sanctions, the onus is placed on those companies to self-regulate and increase surveillance for illegal activity in general, not limited to insider trading. Financial security organizations may also impose sanctions on the individual insider trader, such as fines, which, in tandem with the CJS's financial penalties, should greatly deter people from attempting illegal insider trading, as there would be little financial benefit, and a greater potential financial loss for doing so. The actual implementation of these measures would be relatively simple, only necessitating legislation reforms for the CJS, and policy changes from financial security organizations, such as the provincial regulatory agencies in Canada. Increased surveillance by corporations, through close examination of stock prices, or through the documentation of employees' trades, assist in this process by increasing the odds of catching any criminal or malfeasant behaviour, but more so through their deterrent factor of constantly reminding potential insider traders that their actions are being monitored. Walter (2012) also argues that increasing penalties on individual insiders is necessary to reduce the rate of illegal insider trading as a whole. This stems from his assertion that companies can discipline and penalize their employees, whereas individuals who are unaffiliated with the company lack similar forms of deterrence.  Ultimately, such measures serve to make insider trading a less desirable practice, by having the potential costs, both financial and penal, greatly outweigh the potential gains reaped, thereby lowering the occurrence rate of illegal insider trading in the first place.</p>
                <p>In sum, it is difficult to claim that the deterrence measures addressed in this paper will completely eliminate illegal insider trading, since, as mentioned above, the scope of the crime is rather broad, and not committed exclusively by corporate executives. Increased company surveillance and SEC penalties, for example, would do little to deter a layperson, completely uninvolved with the company who happened upon sensitive information from trading based on that information. Ideally, the punitive measures on the CJS front will be enough of a deterrent in such situations, but without the added regulation from financial institutions, the deterrence is diminished to a degree. However, since a majority of illegal insider trading is done by company higher-ups, the measures outlined in this paper should serve to tackle the most prevalent areas of insider trading, serving to greatly reduce its occurrence rate in turn.</p>

                <p>The sunlit pavement felt warm against my bare feet. The wind fluttered through the trees, and the dewy grass shone in the light. I had to sneak out of the house, before grandma woke up and nagged at me about spending too much time outside again. I slid the door shut behind me and strode to the center of the cul-de-sac; we called it 'the court'. My friends, Ray and Alex sat on the green electrical box near the curb. They were talking about their weekends, and Goku’s amazing fight on T.V last night.</p>
                <p style={{textIndent : 0}}>"Hey!" I called out.</p>
                <p style={{textIndent : 0}}>"What's up, Zobe?" Ray replied, smiling.</p>
                <p style={{textIndent : 0}}>"Ey" Alex murmured, staring down at his Gameboy Advance.</p>
 
                <p>The sun steadily climbed overhead. We grabbed our bikes and our 'swords'--broken hockey sticks with tape covering the edges--and rode off around the neighbourhood. We fought 'demons' and ‘monsters’, saved girls, and traversed the 'dark, dangerous forest' near Rivergrove. Ray, being the oldest, told us stories about the depths of the forest. The ferocious wild animals, and the homeless people who set up nests full of toys and blankets which lured children away from their parents. He raised his hands above his head, and never cracked a smile when telling these stories. His eyes widening and his almond pupils dilating as we listened. Alex would puff out his chest and raise his fists to his face anytime Ray brought the homeless people up.</p>
 
                <p style={{textIndent : 0}}>"That'd never happen to me! They wouldn't be able to take me, I'd knock em all down."</p> 

                <p>…</p>
         
                <p>As we walked, the more claustrophobic the dense forest would become, the narrower the trail would shift, wind, and compress, until it disappeared from sight. We fumbled along. Tiny specks of light poured through the occasional gap in the leaves, and the warm wind and the sound of crackling twigs under our feet, and the chirps of birds entered my ears. The silence made my arms jitter. We crossed a shallow river, hopping from stone to stone. Ray leapt the gap without hesitating. Alex and I toed over each rock first. I would scout the rear while Alex and Ray navigated. I scanned up, and around, for any shadows. I grasped my ‘sword’ and pressed the ‘hilt’ to my side as we marched.</p>
                
                <p style={{textIndent : 0}}>"Almost there!" Ray called, as we approached a steep hill. The hill.</p>
                
                <p>We began climbing, using our 'swords' as walking sticks. My ankles throbbed with each step, my ‘sword’ slipped deeper and deeper into the mud. Ray hadn’t said anything in five minutes, while Alex would sprint, then stall, slow and finally stop, until he caught his breath. Eventually, the trees thinned, then cleared. We emerged at the top to reveal a sidewalk, with several shops on either side of us. We had reached our destination, no broken bones--this time. After spending hours in the forest, we stepped onto Streetsville. The Hasty Market stood down the street from where we exited. We rushed towards it. The bright, fluorescent lights and sounds of the slushie machine made my mouth water. The cool drink and air conditioning inside the store readied me for another several hours of trudging through the forest—which was good, because that was the only way home. As Ray, Alex and I departed from the store, the sun shone a darker orange, and began it’s descent.</p>


                <p style={{textIndent : 0}}>"I've gotta hurry up!" Alex began "my mom is gonna kill me if I'm out too long again."</p>


                <p>I turned to him.</p>


                <p style={{textIndent : 0}}>"Yeah. Plus it's almost time for dinner, I'm starved."</p>
                <p style={{textIndent : 0}}>"It'll have to wait." called Ray "we still need to get home."</p>
                
                <p>We strolled down Streetsville, towards a small break in the road that led back into the forest. Tiptoeing down the steep hill, hopping across the river, eyes open for any demons, or coyotes. We reached the trail and started to race. The shadows behind the trees grew darker and the pockets of light between leaves became scarce and the chirps died down, and the wind grew cooler, and I just realized I’d forgotten to bring a flashlight. We stopped running once we caught the beaming light of the Rivergrove Community Center. We stepped off of the trail, back onto the sidewalk and onwards towards 'the court'.</p>

                    <p>Realize that you aren’t the only one who has doubts. You’ll inevitably come across other people throughout your life. If you’re feeling particularly social, you may even talk to them at some point. Assuming the both of you don’t want to kill each other after that brief interaction, you may even become friends. It’s hard to wrap your head around, but that person went through the same mental hurdles that you did. They have their own thoughts and feelings that may radically differ from your own. Unrequited Love is a great example... of why I’m still single. You can feel strongly about a person--be certain that you’re meant to be together, but the other person doesn’t see you in that same pristine light. The point is, these other people exist. They have their own lives, their own desires, goals, hopes and dreams, go-to porn, and they’re all just as fucked as you are. Stop trying to idolize people into these perfect, infallible beings. Nobody speaks like they’re reading a T.V script. Witty banter isn’t a zero-sum skill. Stop. They’re just like you, imperfect. You have to stop aiming for perfection, because that shit ain’t gonna happen. You have to stop thinking that other people are perfect. Cause they’re really not. Most people are selfish, conceited jerks who just as paralyzed as you are. Wondering if they’re doing the right thing. The harsh reality is, nobody knows what ‘right’ even is. There may not be an objective 'right'. It’s better to just let it go. Be content with your flaws. There are people out there owning their flaws. You can too.</p> 
                    <p>We’re all just specks of cosmic dookie dust that somehow coalesced into a mass of flesh and brain tissue. We live maybe 70 some odd years and then we die. The fact is, in the grand scale of the universe, we are literally <strong>nothing</strong>. Every person you see, even for a brief moment, is a unique individual with their own lives, aspirations, and families. The earth is just a small rock floating in the dark chasm of space, which most likely extends indefinitely. Same goes for the eternity of time. Objectively speaking, we take up no space, and are around for a mere instant. What the fuck does anything matter when the stakes are so infinitesimally small? Answer: it doesn’t. Nothing, no matter how you look at it, matters as much as you think it does. Let it go. You’re fine as is. You’re wasting time and energy worrying about problems that you may forget about in a few months, let alone across the span of time and space. Just try to be a good person, value the people you have around you, and remember that you’re literally made out of star shit.</p>

                Putting the 'Free' Freerunning : The Emergence of Toronto's Parkour Community

                    <br/>
                    <p>Remember the carefree days of youth, when climbing around on the jungle gym was the most exhilarating part of a trip to the local park? Imagine being able to relive that excitement to an even greater degree.</p>
                    <p>Parkour, or freerunning, is the French martial art of momentum and has been steadily rising in popularity around Toronto over the past several years. Practitioners consist of martial artists, daredevils, adrenaline junkies, and those who simply want to move without restriction.</p>
                    <p>It is the art of getting from one point to another in the quickest or most efficient way possible — with some flashy flips thrown in every now and then. There are several basic methods of movement in parkour: rolls, vaults, jumps, and drops.</p>
                    <p>Below the surface, parkour can also be considered an art form and mode of expression. Chris Taylor, a gymnastics instructor and parkour practitioner at U of T, believes that parkour has the power to be used as a means of self-expression. It allows one to move their body rhythmically with a flow that encompasses a feeling of weightlessness, while still offering a wide range of choice in how one tackles a particular obstacle. There are no strict rules as to how one should practice and no set objectives to follow.</p>
